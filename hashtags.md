## Test hashtags        
(Initially hoping to avoid escaping.)

**Intended:**    
```
#hashtag, #secondhashtag
```

#hashtag, #secondhashtag

---- 

**Next, escaping:**        
```
#hashtag, #secondhashtag
```

\#hashtag, \#secondhashtag

---- 

## The problem with search:

The problem here is that github search ignores hashtags completely.  (Well, alerts the searcher it hasn't worked as requested.)
