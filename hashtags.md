## Test hashtags        
(Initially hoping to avoid escaping.)

**Intended:**    
```
#hashtag, #secondhashtag
```

#hashtag, #secondhashtag

---- 

**Next, escaping:**        
```
#hashtag, #secondhashtag
```

\#hashtag, \#secondhashtag

---- 

## The problems with github search:

The first problem here is that github search ignores hashtags completely.  (Well, alerts the searcher it hasn't worked as requested.)

The second problem is they aren't clicky, thus clicking one won't take the inquisitive to a listing of hashtagged terms.

I can't see how I can create hashtags without either manually constructing a set of linked files, or automatically creating them elsewhere and pushing them to github.  The second option is plain silly, whereas the first is simply ludicrous!
